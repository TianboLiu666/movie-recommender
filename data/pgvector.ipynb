I mean, he's first of all, believes thathe can wait this out and he can the war will go on in 2024.Russia has more men than it can send as cannon fodder than Ukraine does.It has three times the population. And they're getting, you know,ammunition now from North Korea. We know that they're getting drugs fromIran. So he wants to wait this out and hopethat someone enters the White House in 2025 who will say, enough, we don't wantto support Ukraine anymore, or that there'll be Ukraine fatigue maybe insome European countries. So he's waiting for Western resolve tocollapse, which it remarkably hasn't yet.But his again, his goals don't stop at Ukraine.They might be a pause. He would you know, Russia wouldn'timmediately then turn its sights on another country.But in the longer run, as long as he's in power and he's running forre-election next year and he will surely get re-elected as long as he's in power,those arms, I think I'm going to change. So he has enough men.##videoAt=244.14Does he have enough money? I mean, can he break his country?Vladimir Putin in his fight, his conquest of Ukraine?That's enough money. I mean, the Russians are still makingmoney on selling oil and gas. You know, despite all of the sanctionsand everything, they they are making money from the hydrocarbon sales.Their economy is set to grow, predicted to grow, in fact, I think by about 2%next year. They've recovered a bit and the economyis doing better than it was before. So they can continue this fight.That's that's what's so surprising to me.I mean, we spoke to you, Angela, early on in the and we've been speaking to youthroughout the conflict. But the general consensus was this wasgoing to be quick and it's been anything but quick.How do you think this war ends as we approach the third year?Right? Well, it's you know, this is the $64,000##videoAt=300.61question that everyone is asking. I mean, at some point it might be thatboth sides recognize that neither of them are going to achieve their fullaims and that they do sit down and negotiate.And that's still what we want to avoid is another frozen conflict, which is tohave some kind of agreement, but which is really only temporary and anagreement that would involve Ukraine unless it makes more progressterritorial. It would territorially it would losesome more territory. And that might end the fighting.You could have a cease fire. You could end the fighting.Right. But that's not a longer term solution tothis. You know, theyou know, the desired solution would be obviously for Russia to withdraw itstroops and to renounce the, you know, territorial claims on these areas thatit claims to have annexed, but which it doesn't fully control.##videoAt=360.76Right. But that that may take much longer.So it probably would be, you know, in the short run at least some kind of acease fire and a temporary solution to this, a longer term solution, it's muchharder to envisage.\""

       "Transcription(text=\"Twitter has been instrumental in American politics and elections. What role do you think X will play in the 2024 US elections? Well our goal is to be as even-handed and fair as possible. Whether someone is right, left, independent, whatever the case may be, that the platform is as fair and as much of a level playing field as possible. And in the past, Twitter has not been, because Twitter was controlled by far-left activists, objectively. They would describe themselves as that. So some of those people are like, well has it moved to the right? Well it's moved to the center, so from the perspective of the far-left, yes it has moved to the right, because everything is to the right from the far-left. But no one on the far-left that I'm aware of has been suspended or banned or de-amplified. But we're trying to be inclusive for the whole country and for other countries too. So there's a diversity of viewpoints. And free speech only matters if people you don't like are allowed to say things you don't like. Because if that's not the case, you don't have free speech and it's only a matter of time before the censorship is turned upon you. Do you think Donald Trump will come back to the platform? He recently posted on Truth Social about this podcast. Truth Social is a funny name. You know, every time you post on Truth Social- It's the truth. Yes. Well, every time, like 100%. It's impossible to lie on Truth Social. I just find it funny that every single thing is the truth. Like 100%? That seems unlikely. I think Gertle will say something about that. There's some mathematical contradictions possible if everything's the truth. Do you think he'll come back to X and start posting there? I mean, I think he owns a big part of truth. Truth Social. Yeah, Truth Social. That truth is a concept. He owns truth. I hope you bought it. So I think Donald Trump, I think he owns a big part of Truth Social. So, you know, if he does want to post on the X platform, we would allow that. You know, we obviously must allow a presidential candidate to post on our platform. Community notes might be really fascinating there. The interaction. Community notes is awesome. I just hope it holds up. Yeah. Like, again, in a political climate where it's so divisive and so many intensely viral posts, community notes is like, it seems like an essential breath of fresh air. Yeah, it's great. In fact, no system is going to be perfect, but the batting average of community notes is incredibly good. I've actually, frankly, yet to see an incorrect note that survived for more than a few hours. How do you explain why it works? Yeah, so the magic of community notes is it requires people who have historically disagreed in how they've rated notes. So in order to write a note, you have to rate many notes. And so we actually do use AI here. So we populate a vector space around how somebody has rated notes in the past. So it's not as simple as left or right, because life is much more complex than left or right. So there's a bunch of correlations in how you rate community notes posts, community notes. So then in order for a community note to actually be shown, people who historically have disagreed on a subject must agree in order for a note to be shown. That's the essential magic of it. I mean, but it's fascinating, because there's a pool of people that have disagreements, and somehow they collaborate through that process of disagreement to come up with context for it. I mean, it's fascinating that it works. Yeah, it kind of makes sense that if people who in the past have disagreed agree about something, it's probably true. Yeah. I wonder, is there a possible somehow emergent thing there that could challenge Wikipedia? Which, Wikipedia is a different kind of thing, which is more like permanent articles about things. But Wikipedia is very hierarchical, whereas community notes is inherently not. There is no hierarchy. And the acid test is, I can't change a community note if somebody put a gun to my head. And community notes has all the code is open source, 100%. All the data is open source, 100%. So you can completely recreate any note in the system independently. So if there was any interference, you'd notice immediately. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. \")"

Ironically, transformers for transformers. You need transformers to run transformers. Somebody has a sense of humor in this thing. I think, yes, fate loves irony, ironic humor and an ironically funny outcome seems to be often what fate wants. Humor is all you need. I think spice is all you need somebody post it. Yeah. So we have a silicon shortage today, a voltage step down transformer shortage probably in about a year and then just electricity shortages in general in about two years. I gave a speech for the sort of world gathering of utility companies, electricity companies andTIMESTAMP=sen[1] I said, look, you really need to prepare for a troubling of electricity demand because all transport is going to go electric with the ironic exception of rockets and heating will also go electric. So in usage right now, it's roughly one third, very rough terms, one third electricity, one third transport, one third heating. And so in order for everything to go sustainable, to go electric, you need to triple electricity output. So I encourage the utilities to build more power plants and also to probably have, well, not probably, they should definitely buy more batteries because the grid currently is sized for real time load, which is kind of crazy because that means you go to sizeTIMESTAMP=sen[1] for whatever the peak electricity demand is, like the worst second or the worst day of the year, or you can have a brand out of blackout and you read the crazy blackout for several days in Austin. So because there's almost no buffering of energy in the grid, like if you've got a hydropower plant, you can buffer energy, but otherwise, it's all real time. So with batteries, you can produce energy at night and use it during the day. So you can buffer. So I expect that there will be very heavy usage of batteries in the future because the peak to trough ratio for power plants is anywhere from two to five. So it's like lowest point to highest point. So like batteries are necessary to balance it out. And then, but the demand, as you're saying, is going to grow, grow, grow, grow. Yeah.
